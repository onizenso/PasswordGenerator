PasswordGenerator
=================

A simple password generator written in Ruby. I am building this as a way
to push my skills with Ruby and experiment with password mangling that is
still somewhat easy to memorize.

Inspiration
-----------

The main inspiration for the project comes from the well-known XKCD comic,
seems like a good way to step away from correct horses with battery staples.
